Today I'm going to delve into I/O Kit and do the things that I can't do with
Core Graphics.

I started using C++ to figure out how to use the library. Trying to do this in
Rust and worrying about FFI would be a nightmare. The documentation on I/O Kit
is non-existent. I'm just looking at examples and looking at the header files.

The code in Karabiner-Elements is spread across many files in many directories.
It's really annoying. I have to cut open all their abstractions to find the
actual code.

I've finally done it! I have a C++ program that emits a volume up event! I've
got key events and aux button events (volume) working. I still need to work out
mouse events. From there, I can work on porting this over to Rust.

It seems like mouse move events are relative. So if I wanted absolute mouse
events, I'd need to get the mouse position.

I just spent an hour going down the rabbit hole of getting the cursor position
using IOKit. Why is this so hard?! I've got so many tabs open.

This is hilarious. I was looking for a way to get the cursor position so that I
could move the mouse to a point. I found `IOHIDSetMouseLocation` and thought,
"that's great but I actually need to get the location not set it". That function
is exactly what I'm looking for. Oh my god.

Now I'm trying to work out how to get the width and height of the display. It's
not really necessary though because I was using that to ensure that the mouse
works in games. I was doing that to make a game controller and I realised that 
the game controller is shit so I removed it.

I think I'm finally ready to start getting this working in Rust. I've reached
the end of the day so I'll do this tomorrow.
