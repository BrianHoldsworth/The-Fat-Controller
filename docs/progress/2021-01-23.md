Yesterday I was struggling with jitter. I had this idea of continuously sending
null messages to keep the network "hot". I'm not sure if that even makes sense
but I'm going to try it anyway.

HOLY SHIT THAT ACTUALLY WORKED!

Every 50 milliseconds, the client sends a binary message but the server ignores
binary messages. All this is doing is keeping the network "hot".

I realised that I could create different client pages for various things. For
example, right now I have a clicker. All it does is click. I could use the URL
for configuration. /click/mouseleft or /click/space.

The server will take the name in the URL string and use it to embed commands in
the JavaScript. The server will then parse and execute these commands.

The tedious code has been written. We can parse a name (like "downarrow") and
turn that into a binary command. Then we can convert that binary command into
an enigo function call. The clicker page can be configured to any single action.
Now I want to experiment with pressure.

The idea has promise but the mobile web browser is giving me trouble. Sometimes
touches aren't registered. Sometimes it gets stuck. Maybe I shouldn't use the
Pressure library and instead do it manually. Maybe that will help. I'm not sure.

Now I want to turn my phone into a trackpad. This should be interesting.

This is so cool. I've just got it moving the mouse around and I can't believe
how smooth it is. It's really smooth on a wired connection and even over wifi
it's pretty smooth.

I have a trackpad. I can move the mouse around. I can use force touch to click
which is really cool. I can also scroll using a two-finger drag gesture. Using
the touch events to read a gesture is a bit tricky.
