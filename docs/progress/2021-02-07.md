I've done the preparation. Now it's time to start working on using I/O Kit from
Rust. The first step is to declare all the functions and data structures from
I/O Kit, then I can build an abstraction on top of them.

I started by making a list of everything. I split everything up so that one Rust
file corresponds to one header file.

I think I've exported everything, or almost everything. Now all I need to do is
build the abstraction layer on top of I/O Kit and we should be good to go!

I've been doing a lot of digging around for I/O Kit examples. The documentation
is very lacking and examples are much more helpful. They're hard to find though
and sometimes it feels like I'm finding them by accident.

I have the mouse events working. Tomorrow I'll work on key events. Core Graphics
is so much more pleasant to use but it won't let me emit volume events.
