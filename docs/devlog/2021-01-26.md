Yesterday I said that I was sick of dealing with someone else's library and
wanted to interface with macOS directly. Today I'm going to take the macOS
implementation from enigo and change it to suit my needs.

I created the a module for interfacing with macOS. It's based on the Enigo
implementation but significantly refactored. In the future, I'll probably add
things for using ScriptingBridge and also generating trackpad gestures. The next
step is to use this module as a replacement for Enigo.

I'm trying to work out how to generate the JavaScript enum from the Rust enum at
build time. It seems like I need to split the macOS into its own crate. Then the
build script and the server can both depend on it.

It was turning into a bit of a mess. I think I'll just do it manually for now.

I was taking a break when I realised that I was overthinking it. I was trying to
generate JavaScript from a Rust enum. I could instead generate both JavaScript
and Rust from something else. The build.rs could have an array of string-value
pairs and generate code from that. Much simpler than what I was trying to do
before.

And it's done. Since I'm still partway though migrating from Enigo, the whole
thing is currently broken.

I dropped all traces of Enigo and now I'm using my own implementation. I'm
really happy with the code base at the moment. One thing that isn't quite right
is that key events need a delay. Applying shift and command keys takes a little
while to take effect so a delay is needed. I really don't want to settle for a
delay. I think I need to generate a flags changed event or maybe apply the flags
directly to the new keyboard event. This is seeming like a problem that I'll
solve tomorrow. Today has been pretty productive.
