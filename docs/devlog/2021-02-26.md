I've got some life stuff going on today so I don't have much time to work on
this.

It occurred to me that the ASCII and Unicode keyboard contexts should probably
allow for pressing and releasing characters. The keyboard context has `key_down`
and `key_up`. It would make sense for the ASCII and Unicode keyboards to have
a similar facility. That would make it possible for them to replace the regular
keyboard context for layout independence. I'll do it for the ASCII keyboard
first and see how it goes.

I implemented it for `AsciiKeyboardContext` and it makes sense. I just need to
make sure that I update the docs to say that modifier keys will be pressed and
released. Now I need to do the same thing for `UnicodeKeyboardContext` this is
going to take a bit longer.

I just realized that I'll need to add four more commands for these four methods.
Oh well.

Alright, the new methods have been implemented for `AsciiKeyboardContext` and
`UnicodeKeyboardContext`. `Command` has also been updated with the new methods.
It's looking good.

I've just had another thought. It probably makes sense for the
`UnsupportedAscii` and `UnsupportedUnicode` errors to store the characters that
are unsupported.

It's looking good. I think I'm just about ready to release v0.5.

I just realized that I haven't updated the interpreter with the new commands.
Ugh. Screw it, I'll just fix it so that it compiles and leave it for another
day.

I just noticed that the documentation for `Context` on Linux-Wayland still
references `InfoContext`. FUCK! Now I need to publish 0.5.1 to fix this. Ugh.
