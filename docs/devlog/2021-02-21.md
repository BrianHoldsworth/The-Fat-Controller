I feel like I can relax now that I've got the X11 unicode keyboard working.
Today I'll implement it for Windows which should be a breeze in comparison.

I have it implemented but I'm not sure how to deal with unsupported characters.
For `AsciiKeyboardContext`, I wrapped the `Result` in an `Option` and returned
`None` in case of unsupported characters. I was thinking about doing the same
for `UnicodeKeyboardContext` but I think this might be a little cumbersome. It's
also less efficient because `Result<(), Error>` is the same size as `Error`
because of `NonZero` but wrapping it in an `Option` doubles the size. The
Windows `Error` is not an enum so I'm not sure what to do about this.

Maybe it does make sense to use an `Option`. Characters not being supported is
a fundamentally different error to an OS level error and it would probably be
handled differently by a client. An `Option` is the simplest solution for now.

An alternative might be to wrap the low level OS error in a high level enum.

```rust
pub enum Error {
    OS(WindowsError),
    UnsupportedAscii,
    UnsupportedUnicode,
}
```

But as I just said, the windows error is not an enum. In fact, only the X11
error is an enum. Maybe I should stop being bothered by imperfect packing.

For now I'll use an `Option` and probably change the way errors work in 0.5.
There are some other things about errors that I want to change. I had this idea
of a `FallibleContext` that has the error type.

I've just finished testing the Unicode keyboard on Windows. It's all working as
expected.

I have some "life stuff" going on so that's all I have time for today.
