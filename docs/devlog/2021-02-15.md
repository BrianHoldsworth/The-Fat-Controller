It's time to implement the Linux module.

I'm not too sure about whether the `ioctl` function is going to work. I've seen
in some places it's declared as having a `const void *argp` parameter. On the
man page, it's a `...` variadic function. I can't seem to find the declaration
in `torvalds/linux`. I've been reading about the way variadic arguments are
implemented and it seems like the arguments are stored on the stack, along side
the other arguments. That would mean `const void *argp` is wrong. It seems that
I might need to be starting up the VM sooner rather than later.

`KeyboardContext` has been implemented. `MouseContext` is up next. I'm not sure
how I'll implement `InfoContext`. I'll worry about that later.

`MouseContext` has been implemented.

Now I need to implement `InfoContext`. Unlike the other platforms, `InfoContext`
is not required to implement `MouseContext`. I might explore the possibilities
after I've tested `KeyboardContext` and `MouseContext` in the VM.

The Ubuntu VM runs much smoother than Windows 10. Holy cow. It almost feels
native. Installing Rust took about two minutes.

The `uinput` kernel module must be loaded before it can be used.
`lsmod | grep uinput` will show the `uinput` module if it's loaded
`modprobe uinput` should load the module.

I'm getting a "no such file or directory" error when trying to open
`/dev/uinput`. Everything I can find online is talking about permission issues
but this seems like `uinput` isn't even there.

Need to do this to enable permission to use `uinput`. You do it temporarily
(until the next reboot).
```shell
chmod 0666 /dev/uinput
```
Or you can do it permanently.
```shell
sudo bash -c 'echo -e "KERNEL==\"uinput\", MODE=\"0666\"" >> /etc/udev/rules.d/50-uinput.rules'
```

Oh my god I forgot the bloody null terminator! It was trying to open
`/dev/uinput` followed by a load of garbage until it found a 0. Ok now I'm
getting somewhere. The program runs without errors but events aren't going
though.

I tried running the example from
[here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/input/uinput.html).
There are no errors. It just doesn't do anything.

Oh mouse integration! I had the same problem on Windows. Ok that makes sense.

The example program is working but the Rust program isn't. At least something's
working. That's progress!

The problem seems to be that I can't have `EV_REL` and `EV_ABS` set at the same
time. Actually, it seems like `EV_ABS` doesn't work at all. Maybe it isn't what
I think it is. I thought it was absolute mouse movement but maybe it isn't. Upon
[further reading](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/input/event-codes.html),
it seems that `EV_ABS` is meant for touch pads. To send absolute events, I'll
need to get the mouse location.

It seems that `REL_WHEEL_HI_RES` doesn't do anything. That's kind of annoying.
It seems like I need to emit them both...? I'd need to accumulate them and emit
when it's above 120. Ugh.

To summarise the `MouseContext` implementation. Relative movement works. Mouse
clicking works. Scrolling is by lines instead of by pixels. Absolute movement
doesn't work. Maybe I need to use the X11 API. Then there's Wayland. Ugh.

The `KeyboardContext` is working fine.

I did some more research. Wayland doesn't seem to have the features that X11
does. They were removed for security reasons which is fair enough. So I think
I'm going to make life easier for myself and use X11 instead of `/dev/uinput`.
Maybe I could keep the existing code around for Wayland. It kinda works...

Also, while I was trying to work this out, I found some code that used
`/dev/uinput` to emit absolute mouse events. It's quite simple really, they
moved the mouse up to the top left corner (because it won't go past to the
edges), then move it back to the desired position.

I'm going to leave the current `uinput` code as it is and move it into a
Wayland module. Partial support for Wayland is better than none at all. Then
I'll create a new module for X11. I'm basically starting again from scratch.

The first thing that I need to do is get a connection to the X server using
`XOpenDisplay`. Then I can get the default root window `XDefaultRootWindow`.
This is the root of the main screen. As with the other two operating systems,
I'm only considering the main monitor in a multi-monitor setup.

Once that is setup, I can move the mouse (either relatively or absolutely),
using `XWarpPointer`. It's also possible to get the current mouse location using
`XQueryPointer` and get the size of a screen using
`XWidthOfScreen` and `XHeightOfScreen`.

For simulating key events, it seems that I need to use the XTest extension.
There's a `XTestFakeKeyEvent` function for that. But then there's also functions
for moving and clicking the mouse so it probably makes sense to use
`XTestFakeMotionEvent` and `XTestFakeRelativeMotionEvent` instead of
`XWarpPointer`.

I think I have it mostly figured out. I'll do the implementation tomorrow.
