Yesterday I got the Windows module to compile and link but I haven't confirmed
that it all works as it should. That's what I'll do today. I'll use a Windows VM
to test everything.

I might be able to release 0.2.0 today but we'll see.

I checked the key codes. `Key::NumpadClear` doesn't seem to do anything but I
think that's because Windows keyboards don't usually have a clear button. Also,
Windows doesn't have an Fn key. Other than that, all the key codes do the
expected thing.

Now I'm on to testing the mouse. I suspected that this might not work inside of
a VM. It sort of works. If I do a mouse down, then some mouse moves, then a
mouse up, I can see the effects of the drag but the mouse itself doesn't move.
If clicking and dragging works in a VM then moving around should work on a real
Windows machine.

I disabled mouse integration and that seems to have solved it. Now I can see the
mouse moving autonomously. As far as I can tell, all the mouse functions are
working correctly.

I've tested the whole Windows module. I made a few tweaks and it all seems to be
functioning correctly. It looks like I'll be able to make another release today!

I'm making sure everything is just right for the release. I published 0.2.0.
Then I noticed that I didn't update the version in the README. It says
`tfc = "0.1"`. For fuck sake. You have to be so careful before publishing. You
have to double and triple check everything. My god it's annoying.

Alright. What am I going to do now? Linux? I think I'll look into what would be
required to implement this for Linux.

There's [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool) that works on X11.
I'd prefer to use X11 directly rather than using this library. I don't want to
make people install a dependency. [Here's](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1262310/simulate-keypress-in-a-linux-c-console-application)
an example of using X11 to send a key stroke.

I stumbled upon [`/dev/uinput`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/input/uinput.html)
which seems to be a lower level interface built into the Linux kernel. This
means that it should work regardless of X11 or Wayland. This is definitely the
way to go. I think I'm going to get started.

I've declared the necessary functions and constants for Linux. That took a
while. Tomorrow I'll fully implement the Linux module. If I have time, I'll fire
up an Ubuntu VM and test it like I did today for Windows. Once all of that is
done I'll be able to release 0.3.0. Hopefully I won't need to release 0.3.1
several minutes later after I notice that I've messed something up.
