Today is cleanup day. I'm going to do the things that I didn't have time to do
yesterday and prepare for 0.3.

I removed `mouse_warp`. There's not really a good reason to use it over 
`mouse_move_abs`. It was also only implemented for Windows and macOS.

I'm working on the READMEs. I added some badges because what's an open source 
project without badges!

I renamed a couple of keycodes. `Return` was renamed to `ReturnOrEnter` and
`Delete` was renamed to `DeleteOrBackspace`. `Delete` is a very misleading name
on platforms other than macOS. The new name fixes that.

TFC is dual licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0 because that seems to be the norm
for Rust crates and Rust itself.

I think I'm almost ready for the release. I'm looking for things to do. I'm
making sure everything is just right.

Ok, I'm doing it. It looks like I didn't mess up this time. There's no need for
a 0.3.1 (at least not yet). Now what am I going to do? I was thinking about
unicode and X11.

I'm currently digging into how to convert unicode characters to key events.
`xkbcommon` can be used for unicode handling. `xkbcommon` can be used with
Wayland so there's a chance that I might be able to implement the unicode
keyboard for Wayland. That's if I understand it correctly (which I probably
don't to be honest!).

I've been at this for a while. I'm slowing starting to wrap my head around this
stuff. It's so bloody complicated. I think I'll continue this tomorrow.
