The X11 Unicode Saga continues! I've laid down the ground work, it's now a
matter of translating C++ to Rust.

It's taken me all day but I finally have a working draft! It compiles, it runs,
it produces unicode key events. It's still pretty messy. I mean, it's messy
enough that I'm too embarrassed to commit while it's in this state.

I found that I was able to remove a lot of code from xdo. It does a lot of stuff
that I don't need it to do so I really think this has paid off. There's also a
fair bit of room for optimizations and refactoring. I just haven't done that
yet!
