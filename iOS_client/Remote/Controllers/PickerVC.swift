// It's beginning to feel like the storyboard is more of a hinderence than a
// help. Using the storyboard makes it difficult to reuse similar things and
// parametize things. This PickerVC should be parametized but the fact that an
// instance of it is created by "the storyboard thing" makes that kind of
// clunky. I have to define things in the storyboard then tweak them in code. It
// would be much nicer to just do everything in code. Passing parameters down to
// child components is a breeze with Vue. The ability to do that easily is what
// Vue is all about.

// I run into a lot of problems with the storyboard file. When I rename a class
// (using the refactor tool), I expect that change to not break the storyboard
// file but of course it does. You're not supposed to edit the storyboard file
// directly. You're supposed to use the clunky interface builder. It was clunky
// when I started using it, and it's still clunky.

// The thing is that I think I'm in too deep with the storyboards to go back
// now. I'd be doing a lot of things from scratch. This app has gotten much more
// complicated than I initially intended.

// UIKit as a whole is a bit annoying to use. For example, putting a UITextField
// inside of a UITableViewCell requires me to manually indent the text. That's
// just dumb. Also, the default text size of table cells is a few points smaller
// than it should be so I have to manually bump it up to 14 pt. I also having to
// manually set the text color of the detail text label to the secondary label
// color. I would have expected the defaults to just do the right thing but that
// doesn't seem to be the case.

// The number keyboard doesn't have a minus sign. So you have to make your own
// number keyboard of cobble something together. There are a lot of these silly
// things that I have to deal with. I keep attributing these problems to my
// inexperience with this but I've been using it for months now. I was loving
// Vue after using it for a couple of weeks.

// UIKit isn't terrible, it's just not nearly as pleasant to use as Vue or the
// web in general.
